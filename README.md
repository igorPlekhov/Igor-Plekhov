This repository contains the code and models developed as part of a Master's thesis project focused on predicting shifts in political opinion using Twitter data from the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. The project combines natural language processing (NLP), behavioral modeling, and political targeting strategies to identify and characterize users likely to change their political stance over time.

The primary dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

The dataset contains over 7 million tweets related to the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, including metadata such as user ID, timestamp, text content, hashtags, and more.
